# rsg-character

Character selection, creation, clothing store and spawn system for **RSG-Core** (RedM).

---

## Features

### Character Select
- In-world character select screen: your characters' peds line up at a location you can configure.
- Multiple character slots per player license (default **4**, configurable).
- Create, select and delete characters, with the camera framing every slot automatically.

### Character Creator
- Male / female selection.
- Body options: body type (slim, sporty, medium, fat, strong), waist, chest, skin tone.
- Detailed face options: eyes, eyelids, eyebrows, nose, mouth, lips, teeth, cheekbones, jaw, ears and chin.
- Hair and beard styles and colours.
- Overlays: scars, freckles, moles, spots, ageing, eye shadow, blush, lipstick and eyeliner, each with colour and opacity.
- Identity form: first name, last name, a nationality dropdown and a birth date (1750–1900).
- A profanity filter for character names.
- Starter items given to each new character.

### Clothing Store & Wardrobe
- Clothing stores in Valentine, Rhodes, Saint Denis, Blackwater, Strawberry, Armadillo and Tumbleweed, with map blips.
- Clothing is split into categories (Head, Shirts & Vests, Belts & Holsters, Coats, Legs, Feet, Hands, Accessories, Misc Gear).
- Each category has its own price, paid in cash.
- Save named outfits, then wear or delete them from the wardrobe (cloakroom).
- The server checks every clothing purchase and outfit change.
- Configurable store door states (open or locked).

### Spawn Select
- A card-based spawn screen with an image for each location.
- Default locations: Valentine, Rhodes, Saint Denis and Blackwater.

### Other

## Dependencies

- [rsg-core](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/rsg-core)
- [ox_lib](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/ox_lib)
- [oxmysql](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/oxmysql)

## Installation

1. Download the resource and put the `rsg-character` folder in your server's `resources` folder (for example `resources/[rsg]/rsg-character`).
2. Make sure your database has the `playerskins` and `playeroutfit` tables. Most RSG-Core installs already include them. If yours doesn't, run:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `playerskins` (
  `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `citizenid` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `skin` LONGTEXT NOT NULL,
  `clothes` LONGTEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `citizenid` (`citizenid`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `playeroutfit` (
  `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `citizenid` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `clothes` LONGTEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `citizenid` (`citizenid`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

3. Ensure the resource in `server.cfg` **after** its dependencies:

```cfg
ensure oxmysql
ensure ox_lib
ensure rsg-core
ensure rsg-character
```

4. Remove or disable any other multicharacter, appearance or clothing resource (such as `rsg-multicharacter` or `rsg-appearance`) so they don't conflict.
5. Edit `shared/config.lua` (see below), then restart the server.

## Configuration

All settings are in `shared/config.lua`.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `RSG.MaxCharacterSlots` | Number of character slots per player license (default `4`). |
| `RSG.ProfanityWords` | Words blocked in character names (`['word'] = true`). |
| `RSG.Nationalities` | Locale keys shown in the nationality dropdown. Their display names are under `nationalities` in `locales/*.json`. |
| `RSG.StarterItems` | Items given once to a new character: `{ item = 'bread', amount = 2 }`. |
| `RSG.CharSelectLocation` | `coords` (vector4) where the peds line up, `spacing` between peds, and `camera` settings (`back`, `height`, `fov`). |
| `RSG.Webhooks` | One entry per log event. Set `enabled`, paste your Discord webhook `url`, and optionally set `name`, `avatar` and `color`. |
| `RSG.SpawnLocations` | Spawn cards: `label`, `coords` (vector4) and `image` (a path under `html/`, such as `img/spawn/valentine.jpg`). |
| `RSG.Prompt` | Control hashes used in the creator (gender select, confirm, camera, rotate, zoom). |
| `RSG.OpenKey` / `RSG.Keybind` | Key that opens the clothing store / wardrobe. |
| `RSG.BlipSprite`, `RSG.BlipSpriteCloakRoom`, `RSG.BlipScale` | Map blip settings. |
| `RSG.SetDoorState` | Store door hashes and state (`0` = open, `1` = locked). |
| `RSG.Zones1` | Clothing store locations: `blipcoords`, `fittingcoords`, `quitcoords`, `promtcoords` and `showblip`. |
| `RSG.Cloakroom` | Wardrobe locations (vector3). |
| `RSG.MenuElements` | Which clothing categories appear under each store menu section. |
| `RSG.Price` | Cash price for each clothing category. |

### Adding a spawn location
```lua
{ label = 'Strawberry', coords = vector4(-1790.0, -390.0, 160.3, 0.0), image = 'img/spawn/strawberry.jpg' },
```
Put the image in `html/img/spawn/`. Existing entries use a locale key (`locale('spawn_locations.valentine')`) as the label. You can do the same for new ones by adding a key under `spawn_locations` in the locale files. A missing image just leaves the card blank.

### Webhooks
Replace the placeholder `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXX` URLs with your own. A category that is enabled but has no valid URL prints a warning to the server console instead of throwing an error.

### Locales
Text is loaded through ox_lib locales from `locales/<lang>.json`. Choose the language with the ox_lib convar in `server.cfg`, for example:
```cfg
setr ox:locale en
```

## Usage

### Players
1. **Join the server.** The character select screen opens with your existing characters.
2. **Choose a slot.** Click an existing character to play, or an empty slot to create a new one.
3. **Create a character.** Pick male or female, shape the body and face, choose hair and makeup, then enter your name, nationality and birth date. Use the on-screen prompts to move the camera up and down, rotate and zoom.
4. **Spawn.** Choose a spawn location from the cards.
5. **Clothing stores.** Go to a store (clothing blip on the map), stand at the prompt and press the open key. Browse categories, try items on, and pay in cash to save the outfit.
6. **Wardrobe.** At a cloakroom, wear or delete your saved outfits.

### Commands
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/loadskin` | Reloads your saved skin and clothing. It doesn't work while you're dead, cuffed, hogtied, lassoed, being dragged, ragdolled, falling or jailed. |
